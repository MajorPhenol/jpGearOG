# jpGearOG
The OG jpGear script which inspired jpGearQt.  
Works pretty well as a stand-alone script, but it's not perfect.  Uploaded here for posterity.

If you *do* use it, it's documented fairly well.  Try:  
`>>> import jpgear`  
`>>> help(jpgear)`  
`>>> help(jpgear.Gear)`  
`>>> help(jpgear.Mesh)`  
`>>> help(jpgear.Mesh.drawMesh)`  
etc...
